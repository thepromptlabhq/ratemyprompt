The prompts was carefully crafted after twelve breakout sessions and a catered lunch that cost more than our cloud budget. Someone suggested we make the AI “sound more visionary but also compliant and funny but not risky.” Legal added a 900 word disclaimer directly inside the prompt. Marketing added “use Gen Z slang but remain timeless.” HR inserted “avoid favoritism but highlight top performers by name.” IT added “optimize for security” but nobody knew what that meant.\n\nThen we pressed Enter.\n\nThe AI responded with a 47 page rap musical about quarterly earnings. It rhymed EBITDA with “you betta.” It named Greg from Finance as “Supreme Cash Wizard.” It also disclosed our internal margin targets in iambic pentameter and somehow worked in a tap dance number about procurement.\n\nNobody know why it did that.\n\nThe VP said the issue was clearly insufficient prompt alignment.

Doesn't feel urgency. Doesn't know what you actually meant. Doesn't understand feelings, intentions, it actually does not understand you, unless you make yourself understandable.\n\nIt only runs statistics on your tokens and generates the most probable continuation.\n\nWhen you write a prompt, define a main idea, define an environment, define specifically what you want. You know what you want, but you don't have the exact key words to make the prompt? Open another chat, do a little research on the field, look for key words, use them, generate coherence, so the ai has no drifting space to go, and you can be as specific as you can, the more specific you are, the better results.\n\nPractical takeaway: before you write your next prompt, answer these:\n\n1. What EXACTLY do I want?\n\n2. How do i make the ai focus on what i want, leaving nothing implicit, since i understand that an ai is not a human who has implicit understanding of most things, but ONLY follows the command that i'm about to give it?\n\n3. What's the best way to position the AI as a professional on the field im targetting? \n\nAnswer those.
